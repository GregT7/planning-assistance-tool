Complete and document all standups in first sprint5. Complete first retrospective with parents6. Format and upload the following to github for the first sprint: standups, retrospective, backlog items and descriptions, sprint goal, definition of done7. Create presentation detailing my experience across the first sprint. Address: what changes I made due to standup, what was accomplished overall, how I am implementing scrum solo style, what is being lost from solo-scrum vs what is maintained (ie losing the team element and diversity of opinion), challenges, retrospective details, and additional slides from the UI/UX backlog. If less time is available, implement only the most important slides.8*. edit sdp: create more detailed timeline9. Give presentation to parents (and Dr. Raymer if possible)10. Complete major sprint feedback for sprint 1 in sprint dashboard in Notion
