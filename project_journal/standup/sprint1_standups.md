# Sprint 1 Standups
- Dates: Saturday 5/10 - Sunday, 5/18

# Intro meeting & progress discussion

Intro meeting & progress discussion
Meeting
@May 10, 2025
Sprint_Ref
Sprint 1
Task
Project Setup
Notes
1. Discovered that my project management approach is neither Scrum (Scrum is a team-based methodology that can not be implemented solo) nor Waterfall (Any methodology writes up management documentation like development plans, requirements, etc)
2. Assessed how the data prediction model will make predictions (what correlations are being leveraged, what data has been collected so far, how reliable can the data collected be used to predict how long something will take)
3. Assessed flaws in data collected for prediction model and introduced idea of approximating some learning curve factor for repetitive tasks to improve prediction times
4. Recommended I get a professor to review plan and project details
5. Pointed out work schedule was too ambitious and prone in causing burnout (3 hours a week, 7 days a week)
6. Challenged value of project vs using existing tools or simply using intuition to make predictions
Actions
1. Delete and reformat project methodology notes of sdp and pop documents
2. Redo sdp’s milestone/backlog table
3. Edit work schedule note in sdp 7 days --> 6 days
4. Add details about formatting and uploading standup + retrospective content on sdp
5. Add details about solo-scrum implementation to sdp (ie using Notion to do everything)
6. Email professors Dr. Raymer or Dr. Shimizu to review project
Agenda
1. Give brief overview of project to parents and get feedback
2. Describe plan and timeline
3. Discuss Agile implementation details
4. Talk about what tasks assigned for the day
Key Decisions
1. Get basic prediction model working using existing data, don’t waste time collecting more information
2. Decrease work schedule from 7 days a week to 6 days a week
3. Delete "Water-Scrum-Fall" as the chosen software development cycle for the pop and sdp documents and replace with explanation of the planned solo-base workflow
4. Get plan reviewed by a professor

# Slow Documentation Day

Slow Documentation Day
Meeting
@May 11, 2025
Sprint_Ref
Sprint 1
Task
Project Setup
Notes
1. Came to the conclusion that standup meetings are not incredibly useful when not much is acted upon in the previous day (due to extenuating circumstances)
2. Pointed out that the inclusion of my parents as the standup feedback source may not be ideal for maintaining an appropriate tone for the workplace. Recommended I include some qualifications of parents to improve professional tone and credibility
3. The professor is under no obligation to help me with this project due to me graduating. Don't expect too much from this request. If anything comes from it, be extra appreciative.
Actions
1. Update sdp methodology description to include qualifications of dad as a project manager working for the government
2. Update Notion product backlog section for all items in sprint 1
3. Update sdp milestone/backlog table to reflect changes in Notion
Agenda
1. Briefly discuss methodology changes (Water-Scrum-Fall —> Solo-scrum) and my email request for review by a professor
2. Discuss plan to complete drafts of sprint 1 backlog descriptions in Notion and update the mvs milestone/backlog tables
Key Decisions
1. Continue daily standups even if not much is accomplished in the previous day. Simply talking about it or the problems that stopped me from working on the project still provides some value for me.

# Questioning Project Philosophy

Questioning Project Philosophy
Meeting
@May 13, 2025
Sprint_Ref
Sprint 2,Sprint 1
Task
Intro to Solo-scrum
,
Project Setup
Notes
1. Dr. Raymer responded and is open to helping me with the project; I responded to the email asking for availability to schedule an appointment. Emphasized not burdening him with too many requests for help or feedback.
2. Reviewed progress on setting up the project - installed and setup basic react application with tailwind implementation
3. Introduced a new problem relating to React ignorance of terms, structure, functionality, and surrounding technology.
4. Completed installation and implementation of React application with tailwind css styling
5. Reviewed the next and final step needed to complete the project setup backlog - download and configure ui/shadcn. Discussed why this is necessary or what this download will do: (1) helps implement crud table functionality that is not easily handled with React naturally and (2) simplifies styling process of project.
6. Debated and clarified the purpose and risks of implementing solo-scrum. Scrum without a team lacks the core aspects and benefits that the agile methodology provides. Without diverse opinions and a balanced team, there is a significant risk of project failure which I will have to deal with. Additionally, solo-scrum does not address the aspect of cooperative problem solving and participation in discussions that would typically be facilitated in standup meetings and group retrospectives. However, with these limitations acknowledged, the solo-scrum approach does provide value through it's overlap in project management, documentation, sprint approach, flexibility, and structure.
Actions
1. Email the professor to schedule a first meeting
2. Install ui/shadcn
3. Test ui/shadcn installation
4. Add subtask items for UI/UX foundation to address React learning curve
5. Add subtasks onto Intro to scrum backlog to address Scrum learning curve
Agenda
1. Review progress with project setup - setup react app with tailwind css styling
2. Evaluate rearranging sprint 1's backlog subtasks and adding on additional tasks to manage React learning curve
3. Talk about seeking help from Dr. Raymer
Key Decisions
1. Continue using solo-scrum methodology but do more research on the topic: add subtasks to Scrum related backlog item
2. Limit my requests for help from Dr. Raymer to once a week or every other week - talk with him to see which option is most appropriate

# React Learning Curve

React Learning Curve
Meeting
@May 14, 2025
Notes
1. Iterated over all items in agenda
2. Identified issue in standup approach: no visuals are used. It's hard to communicate ideas to non-technical reviewers through conversations without any visuals to support concepts.
Actions
1. Create presentation and add skeleton slides
2. Read react article
Agenda
1. Discuss completion of Project Setup Backlog Item
2. Introduce problem: React learning curve, and how I am addressing the problem
3. Talk about the next steps to be completed
4. Address sprint deadline not being sufficient to complete all work
Key Decisions
1. Create some sort of powerpoint with screenshots or other visuals to support progress

# React Progress

React Progress
Meeting
@May 15, 2025
Notes
1. Need to have a more detailed timeline with tasks broken down (recommended schema: id, sprint, backlog, task, start date, end date, duration, percent done. Then for dependencies, schema: id, dependent_id)
2. Put this into an excel file or somewhere in Notion where it can be easily viewed in table format
3. Having a gantt chart isn't necessary but would be nice to have
4. Need to test requirements, probably during each sprint for each backlog
5. The presentation slides for objective, milestones, and backlog items look ok
6. Did a live review of quiz for ~ 40 mins, I understood most things with some patches of knowledge missing (what is a component, class vs functional component, purpose of server)
Actions
1. Create figma mockup
2. Review concepts I didn't fully understand during live quiz explanation
2. Add subtask to scrum: timeline setup
Agenda
1. Discuss React/JavaScript learning curve updates
2. Introduce participation in live MongoDB workshops
3. Discuss next steps: create figma markup, create static web page implementation
4. Use visuals in meeting (hook up laptop to tv using hdmi cord): quiz created, quiz review, backlog items fleshed out, presentation
5. Have quiz/concept review if possible
Key Decisions
1. Create timeline breakdown using the recommended schema in excel at first
2. Look into implementing timeline breakdown into Notion + gantt chart creation
3. Look into creating test plan for backlog items

3. Re-emphasized creating detailed project schedule
Actions
1. Make edits to figma mockup
2. Complete retrospective
3. Complete slides
4. Move unfinished backlog items to sprint 2
Agenda
1. Review figma mockup

# End of Sprint 1

End of Sprint 1
Meeting
@May 18, 2025
Notes
- Reiterated a timeline needs to be created with ideally some visual aid
- Standup presentations need to include the timeline when referencing what has been completed and where I am at in the project lifecycle
- Need to have some off time so I don't get overwhelmed or burn out, having days where I don't work on my project are ok
- Create an additional sprint (sprint 6) and redistribute items to account for rolled over backlog items
- For the impulsively created feature in the ui mockup, don't plan on implementing until after the mvs has been achieved (create copy of mockup and modify it), treat it as a nice to have
- Still need to email Dr. Raymer, fill out my sprint 1 review presentation, format + upload documents to GitHub to close out the first sprint
- Discussed next steps: finish up sprint 1 documentation
- Talked about project manager (Dad) leaving town soon and potentially using zoom to continue remotely
- Talked about scheduling consistent times to meet
Actions
• Finish up sprint 1 presentation
• Email Dr. Raymer to schedule appointment
• Write up rough standup process in txt file, then paste in Notion for tomorrow
• Format and upload sprint 1 documents
• Put meeting times in google calendar, setup timer on phone
Agenda
• Coordinate common meeting time
• Discuss progress accomplished in first sprint and what needs to be completed to finish things up
• Review retrospective
• Assess what to do with impulsively added feature
• Evaluate solutions to congested backlog load for sprint 2
• Reiterate pending actions and what will be addressed today
Key Decisions
- Include timeline visual in standup presentation
- Established goal of trying to do standup at least 4 times per week
- Established goal of doing standup sometime early on in the day, as of right now, it will be around 10:00 AM on Tuesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday but is subject to change
- Don't design additional feature referenced in the initial ui figma mockup, treat it as a nice to have
- Create an additional sprint and redistribute backlog items
- Need to allow downtime to avoid burnout
- Continue to meet when separated using remote video communication tools (Zoom, Webex)
