Sprint Major Feedbacks: | The goal and all milestones were not achieved. Not all of the “Intro to Solo-scrum” and “UI/UX Foundation” backlog item subtasks were completed, albeit a small number of tasks remain. These backlog items were rolled over into the next sprint. This causes a problem where sprint 2 now carries an unfeasible work load so an additional sprint has been added and the remaining backlog items have been redistributed. While only one out of three backlog items were completed this sprint, the progress made was still sufficient. Overall, this sprint’s progress and execution was good.
Sprint Retrospective Notes | Adapting to the agile process is a little bit overwhelming and hard to manage. Meetings were held at inconsistent times (ie later in the day after finishing work) and were not sufficiently prepared for. Meetings lacked structure and were confusing. Additionally, it was hard for participants to understand the progress and status of the project. These solutions were brainstormed and recommended for the next sprint:1. Create a timeline and visual aid to help guide the project to completion, include in every standup presentation2. Standups are confusing when presented without a structured format and no visuals -- create a presentation beforehand with a standard template3. Managing the many aspects of this project is overwhelming -- pool all tasks into the current sprint page to manage tasks and lower burnout4. Standups are held inconsistently and without sufficient preparation -- schedule standups early in the morning and have the presentation completed beforehand
