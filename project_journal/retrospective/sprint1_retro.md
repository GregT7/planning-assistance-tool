Action Plan | 1. Coordinate with parents to find a good meet time (try not to choose a time too early or too late)2. Put standup prep in weekly plan3. Put HDMI chord next to tv for easy presentation setup4. Create template standup presenation slides and save in easily rememberable location5. Prior to standup, put todo items for the day inside the current sprint's respective page, detailing the date6. Email Dr. Raymer to schedule meeting if possible

Issue Identified | Got overwhelmed and burnt out from the agile learning curve. Also, completing tasks from multiple different sources is overwhelming, causing burnout and anxiousness.
Proposed Solutions | 1. Organize a consistent meeting time in the morning for the daily standups2. Fill out the standup agenda prior3. For meetings, create flexible presentation where visuals are included, share this using the tv4. Put specific actions and the day under the sprint file in Notion (Sprint dashboard)- pool from backlog, daily standup, and retrospective5. Email Dr. Raymer and try to schedule a meeting discussing the first sprint and progress so far
Root Cause | •	Tasks come from too many sources (daily standup, retrospective, backlog) and are not placed in centralized area•	Overlooked learning curve for the agile methodology and acclimation/learning of React
Sprint Dashboard | Sprint 1 - Project Foundation & Setup
What Didn’t Go Well | Meetings were disorganized, confusing, and hosted at inconsistent times of the day. Working consecutive days caused fatigue and burnout. Overwhelmed by new standup actions.
What Went Well | Consistent documentation, hosted standup on almost all days, flexible to feedback
