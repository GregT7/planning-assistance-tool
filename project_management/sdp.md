# Software Development Plan

## Administrative


## SDLC
* Agile Methodology: Solo-scrum (made up)
* Project Management Platform: Notion
* Work Schedule: 3 hours per day, 6 days a week
* Testing: Incremental unit testing, integration testing, and End-to-End tests will be used to ensure the functionality and quality of the project during each sprint.
* Project Management: MSV, Software Development Plan (timeline, milestones, extras, backlogs), Project Overview Proposal (tech stack, methodology), Design Specifications, Requirement Specifications
* User Stories: User stories will be collected from the perspective of me as the user, developer, and owner
* Sprint Planning and Execution
  * Duration: Roughly 1 week
  * Contents: Goals, Backlog, Definition of Done (DoD), Retrospective, Daily Standup (with parents)
* Documentation Plan
  * Project management will be handled using Notion including sprint details, standup, retrospectives, and more
  * At the conclusion of the sprint, all content will be formatted and uploaded to GitHub for employers to see my work ethic and process
